## What is Tuskex?

Tuskex (pronounced haâ€§veâ€§no) is an open source platform to exchange [Monero](https://getmonero.org) for fiat currencies like USD, EUR, and GBP or other cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, and BCH.

Main features:

- All communications are routed through **Tor**, to preserve your privacy

- Trades are **peer-to-peer**: trades on Tuskex happen between people only, there is no central authority.

- Trades are **non-custodial**: Tuskex supports arbitration in case something goes wrong during the trade, but arbitrators never have access to your funds.

- There is **No token**, because it's not needed. Transactions between traders are secured by non-custodial multisignature transactions on the Monero network.

See the [FAQ on our website](https://tuskex.exchange/faq/) for more information.

## Status of the project

Tuskex can be used on Monero's main network by using a third party Tuskex network. We do not officially endorse any networks at this time, but they can be found online.

A test network is also available for users to make test trades using Monero's stagenet. See the [instructions](https://github.com/tuskex-dex/tuskex/blob/master/docs/installing.md) to build Tuskex and connect to the network.

Note that Tuskex is being actively developed. If you find issues or bugs, please let us know.
