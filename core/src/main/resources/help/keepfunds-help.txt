NAME
----
keepfunds - keep TSK received during a trade in Tuskex wallet

SYNOPSIS
--------
keepfunds
		--trade-id=<trade-id>

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A TSK buyer completes the final step in the trade protocol by keeping received TSK in his
Tuskex wallet.  This step may not seem necessary from the buyer's perspective, but it is
necessary for correct transition of a trade's state to CLOSED, within the Tuskex server.

The alternative way to close out the trade is to send the received TSK to an external
TSK wallet, using the withdrawfunds command.

OPTIONS
-------
--trade-id
		The ID of the trade (the full offer-id).

EXAMPLES
--------
A TSK seller has informed the buyer that fiat payment has been received for trade with ID
83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea, and locked TSK has been released to the buyer.
The TSK buyer closes out the trade by keeping the received TSK in her Tuskex wallet:
$ ./tuskex-cli --password=xyz --port=9998 keepfunds --trade-id=83e8b2e2-51b6-4f39-a748-3ebd29c22aea
